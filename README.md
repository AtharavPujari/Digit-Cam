# Digit-Cam
A real-time handwritten digit recognition system built with Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV. The project trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the MNIST dataset and uses a live webcam feed to capture handwritten digits, preprocess them, and predict numbers (0â€“9) directly on the video stream.
